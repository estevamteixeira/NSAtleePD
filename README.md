## Introduction

The Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database (NSAPD) is a population-based database that contains detailed province-wide clinical and demographic information from 1988 onwards. Data are abstracted on-site in **Nova Scotia** health care facilities by health information professionals and are contributed to the NSAPD by these facilities. The Reproductive Care Program (RCP), a program of the IWK Health Centre, is the NSAPD custodian.

The population in the NSAPD includes all reported liveborn and stillborn infants at a gestational age of at least 20 weeks or having a birth weight of at least 500 g.
